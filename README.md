# Angular2LoginForm
This Login page is built using Angular2 and TypeScript 

This Page demonstrates my understading on using template driven approach for creating forms.
I have used validations to check the fields of the form, outputting validation error messages, hadnling radio buttons,
Usage of @ViewChild with local references, ngModel directives, displaying the output, setting the default values, 
grouping form controls, and resetting the form.
